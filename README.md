# Müsli App
This is an Android/iOS Application for fetching data from the MÜSLI System of University of Heidelberg.

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request or open an issue about it.

## Prerequisites
Android: minimum Android 4.3  
iOS: minimum iOS 9.0

## Installation
Go to releases page and download the .apk (Android) or .ipa (iOS) and install it on your device or build it from source.  
Currently I'm not able to compile an iOS version since I'm not using a MacBook which is required to compile an app for iOS. 

### Is the application available on Google Play/App Store?
Currently the answer is no. For adding it to these Stores I have to do payments.

- Google Play: single payment of 25$
- Apple App Store: yearly payment of 100$

Since I'm a student at Heidelberg University I could afford the one time payment for Google Play but I just can't afford 100$ per year for the App to be visible on the Apple App Store.  
But: For universities or other teaching facilities the payment of 100$ for the App Store may be waived (if anyone from the MathPhysInfo student council or from the University of Heidelberg found this repository, I would be very happy if they would want to help me get the app into the respective app stores).

## Build from source
1. Setup flutter environment for your [platform](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Clone this repository:  
```git clone https://github.com/niels-beier/muesli_app.git && cd muesli_app```
3. Run `flutter pub get`.
4. You should be good to go.

## Issues
For suggestions and bug reports, just open an issue. When reporting a bug or an error it would be very helpful to include log files which can be generated in the settings of the app.
